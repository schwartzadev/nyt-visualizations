# NYT Visualizations
This is a collection of Python scripts that generate visualizations of information from The New York Times via the NYT API

## Setup
 * Get a key at [developer.nytimes.com](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
 * Make a file named api.txt, place it in this root directory, and put your api key in the file, on the first (and only) line.
 * Run `nyt.py`
